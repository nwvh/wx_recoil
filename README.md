Hello, today I am releasing another free script, which is **WX RECOIL**

This is a relatively simply coded script which does mostly two things that you can toggle:
1. Shake your camera while you're aiming (Drunk aiming)
2. Move your screen while you're shooting (Simulates realistic recoil)



It can do more like hide the GTA crosshair, disable weapon punching etc. etc. just look into the config file.
